PLEASE NOTE: all tickets purchased online for GTM are ‘print at home' e-tickets that will be emailed to you after making the purchase. You need to print the attached pdf file and bring it along on the day.

How many tickets can I buy in one order?  

There is a LIMIT of four (4) tickets per customer. 

I bought my tickets online, how do I get a hard copy of my GTM tickets?  

Your individual tickets will be sent to your nominated email address, as a pdf file attached to your booking confirmation email.

These tickets can be opened with Adobe Reader and printed in either black and white or colour. Just make sure that the barcode and all names and dates of birth are visible. Or you can display the PDF file on your smart phone and that can be scanned at the gates. Handy tip, make sure your phone is charged and in case of limited 3/4G signal, we recommend saving a copy of the ticket to your phone image gallery.

 Can I post a photo of my ticket on social media?

As excited as you might be GTM advises NOT to post a photo of your ticket with the barcode visible on any social media sites.

But I didn’t receive my tickets via email, what should I do? 

Log in to your moshtix account used for the purchase and select ‘Show My Ticket’ for the relevant event. You then have the option to view the ticket in your browser, download or resend them to an email.

Still need help or you need to change your information on the e-ticket? Please get in touch with moshtix via the Support tab on their website: http://tixsupport.moshtix.com.au

Can I refund my ticket?  

Tickets to GTM are non-refundable. If the event is cancelled a refund will be processed. Don't worry, you will be contacted with instructions on what to do if this happens.

Can I give my ticket to a friend if I can’t go?   

Yes, BUT if you purchased your ticket via moshtix you need to change the ticket into your friend’s name. It costs $6.00 and the person who originally purchased the ticket must log in to their moshtix account used for the booking. 

If you have any problems please contact please get in touch with moshtix via the Support tab on their website: http://tixsupport.moshtix.com.au

If you purchased a hard copy ticket from a GTM outlet, you can simply give that hard ticket to your friend.

Can I sell my GTM tickets on e-Bay or Gumtree?

No, absolutely not. 

GTM tickets may not be re-sold as a commercial transaction under any circumstance. Cattleyard Promotions reserves the right to void any tickets without compensation if the original purchaser has sold them. The new ticket holder may be refused entry or be evicted from the venue. Again this measure, although extreme, is to combat scalpers.

Should I buy a GTM Ticket from e-Bay or Gumtree? 

We don’t recommend this.

GTM does not recommend purchasing tickets through any unofficial channels such as e-Bay or Gumtree and cannot guarantee a patron entry into the event with a ticket purchased via one of these channels.

If I lose my hard ticket purchased from an outlet, can I replace it? 

No, if you lose your hard ticket it cannot be replaced. You’ll have to buy a new one so treat these like gold.

What if I accidentally lose my ticket on the way to the GTM?  

If you purchased your ticket via moshtix, you, and everyone listed on the ticket, will have to go to a special line. There will be a nice and friendly ticketing customer service representative who can help you but they will be busy, so it may take some time. You will have to have photo ID with your name and date of birth. 

If you purchased your ticket at an independent GTM outlet, it cannot be replaced; you will need to purchase a new ticket from the event box office (unless the event is sold out).

Do I need to bring my ID? 

If you’re UNDER 18
And you purchased your tickets from moshtix you just need to bring one of the below as proof you are the ticket holder;
•ATM card
•School card
•Library card 
•Bus pass 
•Or some other form of ID that has your full name on it 

If you purchased a hard ticket – you don’t need to worry about ID as the ticket doesn’t have your name on it.

If you’re OVER 18
If you purchased any type of ticket to GTM and you’re over 18 and you would like to access the bar – YOU NEED TO BRING VALID PHOTO ID.
Valid photo ID includes one of the following:
